# A standard Fibonacci sequence generating, say, 8 numbers, might be 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13

# Generalizing a bit, I can have the program ask for user input of the first two numbers
# to kick off an additive sequence, and then generate the 8 numbers, that follow from the two number input.
# So, for instance, if the first two numbers are 0 and 1, you get the above sequence.

def fibonacci(inp1, inp2, x):
    sequence_list = []
    
    current = inp1
    next = inp2
    
    for i in range (x):
    
        sequence_list.append(current)
        current = next
        next = sequence_list[i] + current
   
    return sequence_list    
    

# function to produce a printed out fibonacci sequence
def print_fibonacci(inp1, inp2, x):
    print (str(fibonacci(inp1, inp2, x)))
    
# Now,the main program run asks for two inputs and prints a sequence in response to the inputs
# The number of sequence numbers to generate is left here as a direct argument to
# specify in the main print statement, '8' numbers, say.

inp1 = int(input("Enter a number: "))
inp2 = int(input("Enter another number: "))
